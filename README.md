# PowerShell Scripts





> [!READ THIS FIRST]
> Given the nature of some of the scripts, make sure to get the versioning correct when you load the script into your PS session.  Sometimes you will need to use an older version or a newer version depending on the task.  While I try my best to make sure I have the right checks in place for the version of PowerShell required. I might, and probably will make mistakes!!

Some scripts will need the latest PowerShell 7.x Which can be downloaded directly from Microsoft GIT in the [release section](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases).
In turn you will also need to have the latest PnP.PowerShell module installed and updated and be sure to use the -Interactive flag if you are modifying this code for the SSO to Exchange / SharePoint etc...
